# Eduford 🎓

🎯 **Finished my second project – a responsive multi-page educational website.**

## 🚀 About the Project

Eduford is a responsive multi-page website built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**. This project was part of my ongoing web development practice to improve my frontend skills and understanding of responsive design.

From layout structure to mobile responsiveness, this build challenged me to think beyond how a site *looks*—and focus on how it *feels* across devices. Every section, from the clean hero banner to the polished footer, was crafted with usability and user experience in mind.

## 🛠 What I Learned

- Building multi-page layouts with clean navigation
- Applying responsive design principles using media queries
- Structuring semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Styling consistently with CSS while maintaining flexibility
- Iterating on visual design to improve user flow

## 💡 Highlights

- 🔹 Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 🔹 Clean and intuitive UI
- 🔹 Pure HTML and CSS — no frameworks or libraries
- 🔹 Hands-on learning experience in frontend fundamentals

## 🧠 Reflections

Every project I build brings not only better code, but better **confidence**. It’s rewarding to see how even simple tools can bring big ideas to life. And honestly — turning concepts into real, working websites? Kinda addictive. 🔥
