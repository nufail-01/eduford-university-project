# Eduford University 🎓

🎯 **Finished my second project – a responsive multi-page educational website.**

## 🚀 About the Project

Eduford is a responsive multi-page website built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**. This project was part of my ongoing web development practice to improve my frontend skills and understanding of responsive design.

From layout structure to mobile responsiveness, this build challenged me to think beyond how a site *looks*—and focus on how it *feels* across devices. Every section, from the clean hero banner to the polished footer, was crafted with usability and user experience in mind.
